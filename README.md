# ESP32WifiTemperatureServer
# By Kreezy(KRosa) 1.30.2018

This is an example of a ESP32 Wifi temperature server using a DHT-11 sensor.

Load the code, enter your SSID and password where needed, upload than check the serial monitor
Take the IP it gives you and enter that into a web browser
The current temperature reading should show up on the webpage served
The webpage is set to refresh itself every 5 seconds

If your onboard LED is not a solid blue than you entered your SSID info wrong

If the ESP32 does connect to a network, the onboard LED will stay lit until disconnected
